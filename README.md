# MyTurtleLegacy

*This project was made by William Convertino, Alex Desbans, and Luke Josephy.*

The MyTurtle application allows users to write and run scripts for a virtual drawing turtle. It includes compatibility with the standard LogoVisualizer program, 
the L-system Visualizer program, and the Darwin Species Simulator.

NOTE:
A new version of MyTurtle is currently in the works! We hope to have it done some time before January.
